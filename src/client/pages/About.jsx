We are dedicated to creating a supportive community that empowers Black women, immigrants, and the children of immigrants to embrace their mental health with courage, understanding, and grace. Our mission is to connect you with therapists who not only share your racial identity but also understand the nuances of your cultural heritage, ensuring a therapy experience that truly resonates with your individual story.

                ThriveTribe was born from a desire to bridge the gap between Black women and mental health resources that affirm their identity and experiences. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by Black women, immigrants, and their children, we set out to create a platform where finding a therapist who truly understands feels seamless. Our therapists are not just professionals in their field; they are empathetic individuals who respect and honor your cultural background, language, and heritage.
